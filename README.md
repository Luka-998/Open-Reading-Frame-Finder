### ORF Finder â€” Prokaryotic DNA 

#### Project overview

__ORF Finder__ is a compact, well-documented Python tool to find all possible open reading frames (ORFs) in a multiple prokaryotic FASTA sequence.
The goal is to detect every start and stop combination (including ORFs that start but have no in-frame stop), capture small ORFs, translate predicted ORFs to protein sequences, and later compare translated products to known proteins (e.g., BLAST).

This repository is intended as a clean, teachable bioinformatics project suitable for further data-science / ML extensions and for use in a polished GitHub portfolio.
